# CodeAlpha Internship - Basic Chatbot

## About This Project
This is a simple chatbot program that I created using Python as part of my CodeAlpha Internship task.

The chatbot runs in the terminal and replies to some basic messages like "hello", "how are you", and "bye".

## How It Works
- The program takes input from the user.
- It checks the input using if-elif conditions.
- Based on the message, it prints a reply.
- The chat continues until the user types "bye".

## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:
- How to use while loops
- How to use if-elif statements
- How to take user input in Python
- Basic string handling

## How to Run
1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Open terminal.
3. Run the command:

   python chatbot.py

4. Start chatting with the bot.

## Internship Task
This project was completed as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship.
